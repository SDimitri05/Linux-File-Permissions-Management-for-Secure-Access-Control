# Linux-File-Permissions-Management-for-Secure-Access-Control

Examined and Modified File Permissions Using Linux Commands to Enforce Authorization Policies.

Conducted a detailed review and modification of file and directory permissions within a research teamâ€™s Linux environment to ensure properauthorization and secure access controls. Utilized commands such as _**ls -la**_ to audit current permissions, interpreted 10-character permission strings, and applied **_chmod_** to restrict write access where unauthorized. Managed permissions on hidden files and sensitive directories, aligning access withorganizational security policies. This project enhanced my command-line proficiency, deepened understanding of Linux permission structures, andreinforced best practices for maintaining system security in multi-user environments.
